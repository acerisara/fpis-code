# Functional Programming in Scala exercises
![example workflow](https://github.com/acerisara/fpis-code/actions/workflows/gradle.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

This repo contains solutions to the exercises proposed in the first edition of the [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)
book by P. Chiusano and R. Bjarnason. I'll add chapters as I go through the book and update the code when I find new / better implementations or gain new insights.
